In the article "Why I Need My Own Chatbot to Deal With Customer-Service Chatbots", Alexandra Samuel discusses the need for a personal chatbot to handle interactions with often-annoying customer-service chatbots. 

There're  several useful functionalities for the consumer-side chatbot, including memorizing preferences, pre-empting support calls, trawling for similar complaints, waiting in line, placating support agents, pestering persistently, and taking surveys. The goal is to save time, reduce frustration, and improve the overall customer-service experience.
