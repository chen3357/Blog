Apple has fallen behind competitors like Microsoft and Google in the new AI arms race. 

Despite early progress on Siri, Apple seems to be slowed by internal decisions and caution.

Apple plans to unveil new AI features at its upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference. 

It will work to integrate AI into its products while maintaining user privacy. It is also exploring partnerships with major AI developers, such as Openai, to enhance its capabilities. 

This is a major turning point for Siri and Apple's AI strategy.
