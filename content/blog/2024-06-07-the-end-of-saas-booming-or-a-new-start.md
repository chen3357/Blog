Salesforce's recent financial results have shown a significant slowdown in growth, with revenue and billings falling short of expectations. 

Salesforce reported a record-low 10.7% year-over-year revenue increase and projected just 7% growth for the current period. Billings grew by only 3%, another record low. 

The adjusted operating margin is above 32%, for the first time. However the company's shares dropped nearly 20%. The SaaS software sector is also facing challenges, with major deals taking longer to close and increased scrutiny on investments, particularly in AI. Many analysts suggest that AI investments are crowding out other enterprise software spending, raising concerns about the future monetization of AI for cloud software companies.
